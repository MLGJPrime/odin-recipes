Odin Project: Recipes

My project is to create a new HTML page consisting of an index page and some links to a few recipes. CSS will not be used for this project, so the page will be basic and without any added style.

For my second part of the project, I am adding some basic CSS in the mix, making the page look a bit more user friendly.
